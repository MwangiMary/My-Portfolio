Hi, I’m Mary Muthoni — a driven and ambitious woman with a deep passion for technology and innovation. Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by how technology shapes our world and solves everyday problems.

Currently, I’m an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Information Technology at Kiriri University, while simultaneously sharpening my skills in software engineering at PLP Academy. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and the desire to create meaningful digital experiences.

I specialize in software engineering, digital marketing, and IT, always eager to learn new programming languages and tools. When I’m not coding or studying, you’ll find me exploring the realms of cybersecurity or networking with fellow tech enthusiasts. I believe the best growth happens when we connect, collaborate, and challenge each other.

My goal is to build innovative solutions that empower people and make an impact in our digital world. Every day, I’m working on expanding my expertise, participating in projects, and preparing myself for a professional career that truly reflects my passion.

Thank you for visiting my space — I hope to connect, share, and grow together!
